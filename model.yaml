### Describe block category 0 ###
block_0:
  # A ratio (%) of block category 0 over entire flash blocks in a chip.
  # For example,
  # if the number of blocks in the chip is 120,
  # `ratio: 10` means that the the number of flash blocks with category 0 is 12.
  ratio: 10

  # For each erase loop, describe followings:
  # 1. erase latency (tBERS) in ns.
  # 2. the number of fail bits.
